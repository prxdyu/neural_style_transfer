# Neural Style Transfer Repository
This repository contains an implementation of the Neural Style Transfer algorithm using PyTorch. Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique that allows the artistic style of one image to be imposed upon another. This README file provides an overview of the project structure, how to use the code, and additional information.

### Overview
Neural Style Transfer leverages the representations learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images. This repository utilizes the VGG19 model pre-trained on ImageNet to extract features from both content and style images. By minimizing a loss function, the algorithm adjusts the pixel values of a generated image to match the content of one image and the style of another.

### Implementation Details
The core implementation consists of the following components:

VGG Network: The VGG class is defined to extract features from the intermediate layers of the VGG19 model. This is used to capture both content and style representations from images.

Image Loading and Processing: Images are loaded and pre-processed using torchvision.transforms for consistency in size and format.

Loss Calculation: Content loss is calculated as the mean squared difference between the feature maps of the generated image and the content image. Style loss is computed based on the differences in Gram matrices of feature maps from the style image and the generated image.

Training Loop: The algorithm optimizes the generated image to minimize the total loss, which is a combination of content and style losses weighted by hyperparameters.
#### How to Use the `stylize` Function

Clone this repository to your local machine:

-     bash
      Copy code
      git clone https://github.com/your_username/neural-style-transfer.git

To utilize the `stylize` function for styling your images using the Neural Style Transfer algorithm, follow these instructions:

1. **Import the Function**:
   Make sure you have access to the `stylize` function either by importing it directly from its containing module or by copying the function definition into your script.

       
         from neural_style_transfer import stylize
2. **Provide Image Paths**:
Define the paths to your content and style images. These paths should point to the respective images on your local machine.


          content_image_path = "path_to_your_content_image.jpg"
          style_image_path = "path_to_your_style_image.jpg"

3. **Adjust Parameters (Optional)**:
If you want to customize the styling process, you can adjust the function parameters. The function allows you to specify the total number of optimization steps, learning rate, as well as the weights for content and style (alpha and beta).


        total_steps = 6000
        learning_rate = 0.001
        alpha = 1
        beta = 0.01

4. **Call the Function**:
Invoke the stylize function with the provided arguments.


        stylize(content_image_path, style_image_path, total_steps, learning_rate, alpha, beta)
